Tips for completing the projects:

Chapter 1: I found it helpful to create an Excel workbook of truth tables for each of the basic chips.  As I was building a new chip, I would reference the prior ones to see how they could be manipulated to provide the necessary output.  There is a copy of my Excel file with notes at the root of the project folder in this repo.

Chapter 2: Building the ALU
There are a couple of learning unlocks that I discovered on the way that allowed me to greatly simplify the code and build the ALU without helper chips and only using the built-in chips from Chapters 1 and 2.
* When considering how to provide conditional (if/then) functionality, take a hard look at the Multiplexor chip Mux.  
* When implementing the ng and zr output signals, you may want to create a subbus from an internal pin.  Subbussing internal pins is not supported by the Hardware Simulator.  To work around this limitation, I initial built some helper chips and was able to successfully complete the assignment, knowing that approach was not recommended by the instructors.  The missing piece of information is documented in the Survival Guide but I didn't grok it right away.  it is possible to create mutiple outputs from a chip.  For example, And16 (a=a, b=b, out=out, out[15]=t1, out[0..7]=tlsb, out[8...15]= tmsb, and so on).  With this bit of knowledge, you should be able to create all the additional logic necessary for the ng and zr signal outputs.

Chapter 3: Memory
* All of the needed clues for the project are described in the videos.
* First time using DMux8Way as a building block to pass the load input to the right chip
* First time using Mux8Way as a building block to determine which Register or RAM to read
* Note that the final RAM chip RAM16K just needs 4 RAM4K chips.  The others required 8.

Chapter 4:
* See comments in the code.

Chapter 5:
* When building the Memory chip, remember to use the built in Screen and Keyboard chips vs. creating your own with RAM and Register chips.
* The CPU chip is by far the most difficult.  I tried to work out the control bits and logic on paper and was able to get close enough to fix the errors generated by the test script.
* While working on this assignment, I heavily referenced the slides (45-47) from chapter 4 https://b1391bd6-da3d-477d-8c01-38cdf774495a.filesusr.com/ugd/56440f_12f488fe481344328506857e6a799f79.pdf as well as the circuit diagram slides 45-48 from chapter 5 https://b1391bd6-da3d-477d-8c01-38cdf774495a.filesusr.com/ugd/56440f_96cbb9c6b8b84760a04c369453b62908.pdf
* Hint: I found it helpful to rename the instruction[0..15] bits to conform to the Hack language specification 1 1 1 a c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 d1 d2 d3 j1 j2 j3.  For example, And (a=instruction[5], b=true, out=d1) renames the index 5 instruction bit to d1 which matches the spec.
* Hint: Place on the chips and their interfaces in the script first and connect the inputs and outputs to the circuit diagram. Fill in the control logic as the next step.
* Hint: the ALU output bits are useful for controling the program counter pc chip
* Hint: the inputs for the ALU are very simple and straight forward in contrast to those for the Mux16, Register and Program Control chips. You will need to use some logic gates to derive most of those controls.
* Hint: to determine how to chose between the A register and the M memory input for the ALU input, carefully study the hack language spec in chapter 4 for the C instruction specification.
